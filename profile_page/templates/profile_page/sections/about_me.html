            I'm Robert ÄŽurica, a software developer with over 4+ years of experience, specialized in web application and information systems development. I have experience working with a variety of technologies including Python, Django, MariaDB, and
            Docker. I believe that a good-looking application is as important as its functionality. My focus is on delivering high-quality, stable and secure solutions. Let's connect and explore how I can bring my skills and expertise to your next
            project.
